                <h3>The Most Suscrived Youtuber</h3>
                <p>Kjellberg became the most-subscribed YouTuber on 15 August 2013, and after being briefly surpassed in
                    late 2013 by YouTube Spotlight, firmly held the title until early 2019, when he publicly vied for it
                    with Indian record label T-Series. The latter established a significant lead in April that year,
                    although Kjellberg's channel remains as the second-most-subscribed on the platform, having received
                    over 106 million subscribers, as of 2 August 2020. From 29 December 2014 to 14 February 2017,
                    Kjellberg had the most-viewed channel on YouTube. As of 27 May 2020, his channel has received over
                    25 billion views, ranking as the 16th-most-viewed channel on the platform. Both his channel's
                    subscriber and view counts rank as the most for among those operated by an individual. </p>
